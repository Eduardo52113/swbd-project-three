          Welcome to my website. I'm an engineering student at Illinois Tech pursuing
        a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering. I'm currently looking for
        internships in the Automotive and Robotics industry. Here are my areas of Interest.

            Like other car enthusiasts, my love for cars started with my Dad's 1996 Chevy Silverado Cheyenne
2500. This truck was part of my childhood. He bought it brand new and used it ever since. But
because of his stroke, the truck was parked in the garage for about 9 years. Later, my family saved
up some money and bought my car. To save money on car repairs and general maintenance, I started to
wrench on my car. Through this, I gained a better understanding on how cars function. Most of my car
knowledge comes from my Dad, his books of automotive encyclopedia, and YouTube.

          <p class="auto-paragraph">
            After gaining experience from fixing my car, myself, my brother, and my dad decided to bring the
  truck back to life. After changing the fuel pump, battery, and added 5 gallons of gas, it started
  up as if nothing happened. The sound of the small block v8 roaring again from sleeping put a smile
  on our faces. All 8 cylinders were firing and the transmission still worked! To me and my brother,
  we were surprised that it was still working after just sitting for a long period. But to my Dad,
  it was to no surprised as he was confident in his truck. Fixing the truck made me realize that I
  enjoy working with my hands and I gained an interest to pursue a path in the automotive industry.

            When it comes to Robotics, I start geeking out. Growing up watching NOVA and learning about the
Mar's Rover during middle school, it fascinated me on how NASA was able to control or program a
robot to perform different tasks on a different planet. But in science fiction through different
mediums such as video games (<a class="hyper-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EoIbv_CWsk"
target="_blank">Titanfall 2</a>), and movies (<a class="hyper-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvxVdfkY-E"
target="_blank">The sound of the heavy metallic steps of an AT-AT</a>) revealed on how
creative we can get when designing robots whether for entertainment or helping the world.

                This made me pursue my education into engineering. In Spring 2018, I was invited to be a
        volunteer in the electrical team of IIT's Nasa Robotics Mining team. This gave me firsthand
        experience on what it is like to build a robot. I can easily say, it is "easier said than
        done". I started out by helping to make wires for electrical components and assisted with
        troubleshooting electrical problems. Some nights I stayed with the team until midnight to
        prep the robot for competition. Seeing the robot come to life reminded me that NASA
        engineers are doing something similar in prepping their space probes and other equipment
        that are to be launch into space. Now that I'm part of thte team, I'm currently designing a
        PCB for power delievery for Low and High voltage which hopefully become a motherboard for the
        robot being built. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to attend the Spring 2018
        Mining competition because I joined the team late. But I'm looking forward to attend the
        Spring 2019 competition. In the wide field of robotics, I'm interested in mechs and
        exoskeletons.

              I was introduced to a Maker Space called Pump Station One when I went with a friend to work on a
  wind turbine project for a club at my Community College. He was a member of the Maker Space and he showed me
  around the site. It amazed me of all the tools that were at the readily available to create stuff.
  The site had tools such for wood works, welding, 3D printing, laser cutters, electronics, and they
  even had an electron microscope (it is no longer there). When I was at pump station one, everyone
  was welcoming, and they helped each other working on their own projects.

          <p class="maker-paragraph">
            I remember helping someone to cut open a transformer so that he can use the internal components
  for his Diy speaker. Later, in the day, they invited everyone in the site to a big dinner to
  celebrate someone’s birthday. Through the celebration, I met others and learned about projects
  they were working on. The people I met range from community members, students, welders,
  carpenters, and programmers/hackers. A Maker space is basically a place where tools are readily
  available, and people can gather to create, invent, and share knowledge. Having a site such as
  Pump Station One at other locations encourages anyone to become builders, critical thinkers, and
  problem solvers.
