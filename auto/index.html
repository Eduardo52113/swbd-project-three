            Like other car enthusiasts, my love for cars started with my Dad's 1996 Chevy Silverado Cheyenne
2500. This truck was part of my childhood. He bought it brand new and used it ever since. But
because of his stroke, the truck was parked in the garage for about 9 years. Later, my family saved
up some money and bought my car. To save money on car repairs and general maintenance, I started to
wrench on my car. Through this, I gained a better understanding on how cars function. Most of my car
knowledge comes from my Dad, his books of automotive encyclopedia, and YouTube.

            After gaining experience from fixing my car, myself, my brother, and my dad decided to bring the
  truck back to life. After changing the fuel pump, battery, and added 5 gallons of gas, it started
  up as if nothing happened. The sound of the small block v8 roaring again from sleeping put a smile
  on our faces. All 8 cylinders were firing and the transmission still worked! To me and my brother,
  we were surprised that it was still working after just sitting for a long period. But to my Dad,
  it was to no surprised as he was confident in his truck. Fixing the truck made me realize that I
  enjoy working with my hands and I gained an interest to pursue a path in the automotive industry.
