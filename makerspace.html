              I was introduced to a Maker Space called Pump Station One when I went with a friend to work on a
  wind turbine project for a club at my Community College. He was a member of the Maker Space and he showed me
  around the site. It amazed me of all the tools that were at the readily available to create stuff.
  The site had tools such for wood works, welding, 3D printing, laser cutters, electronics, and they
  even had an electron microscope (it is no longer there). When I was at pump station one, everyone
  was welcoming, and they helped each other working on their own projects.

            I remember helping someone to cut open a transformer so that he can use the internal components
  for his Diy speaker. Later, in the day, they invited everyone in the site to a big dinner to
  celebrate someoneâ€™s birthday. Through the celebration, I met others and learned about projects
  they were working on. The people I met range from community members, students, welders,
  carpenters, and programmers/hackers. A Maker space is basically a place where tools are readily
  available, and people can gather to create, invent, and share knowledge. Having a site such as
  Pump Station One at other locations encourages anyone to become builders, critical thinkers, and
  problem solvers.
