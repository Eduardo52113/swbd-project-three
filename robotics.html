            When it comes to Robotics, I start geeking out. Growing up watching NOVA and learning about the
Mar's Rover during middle school, it fascinated me on how NASA was able to control or program a
robot to perform different tasks on a different planet. But in science fiction through different
mediums such as video games (<a class="hyper-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EoIbv_CWsk"
target="_blank">Titanfall 2</a>), and movies (<a class="hyper-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvxVdfkY-E"
target="_blank">The sound of the heavy metallic steps of an AT-AT</a>) revealed on how
creative we can get when designing robots whether for entertainment or helping the world.

                This made me pursue my education into engineering. In Spring 2018, I was invited to be a
        volunteer in the electrical team of IIT's Nasa Robotics Mining team. This gave me firsthand
        experience on what it is like to build a robot. I can easily say, it is "easier said than
        done". I started out by helping to make wires for electrical components and assisted with
        troubleshooting electrical problems. Some nights I stayed with the team until midnight to
        prep the robot for competition. Seeing the robot come to life reminded me that NASA
        engineers are doing something similar in prepping their space probes and other equipment
        that are to be launch into space. Now that I'm part of thte team, I'm currently designing a
        PCB for power delievery for Low and High voltage which hopefully become a motherboard for the
        robot being built. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to attend the Spring 2018
        Mining competition because I joined the team late. But I'm looking forward to attend the
        Spring 2019 competition. In the wide field of robotics, I'm interested in mechs and
        exoskeletons.
